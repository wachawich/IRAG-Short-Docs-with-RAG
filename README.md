# IRAG - Short Document with IMPROVE RAG


This project was initiated from our attempt to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for general QA with documents.
However, it couldnâ€™t be done effectively due to the large volume and complexity of the data, which rendered a regular RAG approach insufficient. 
This project is specifically designed to work well with short documents, as the task involves shorter documents, making this method highly efficient. 
That's why this project was developed.
